## Summer Workshop in Creative Science Writing

From 2017-2019, I co-organized the [Summer Workshop in Creative Science Writing for Undergraduates](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/particles-and-prose) at the University of Pittsburgh together with Marylou Gramm and Sam Pittman of the Department of English. The goal was to foster efforts by undergraduate “Writers in Residence” in research labs to communicate science in a compelling, accessible manner to non-scientists using creative writing (e.g. poetry, narrative nonfiction, etc.). 

Each summer, the Workshop published selected works by the Writers in Residence in the *Lab Musings* online magazine on *Medium* (see [2017](https://medium.com/pitt-undergraduate-science-writing), [2018](https://medium.com/lab-musings-summer-2018), and [2019](https://medium.com/lab-musings-2019) issues). In addition, a [Being Human](https://soundcloud.com/humanities-pitt/stories-of-art-and-science-an-interview-with-lee-gutkind) podcast was created of an interview with Lee Gutkind (“the Godfather behind creative nonfiction”) by Dan Kubis at the grande finale event of the 2018 Workshop. Funding for the Workshop has been provided by the University of Pittsburgh Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences, an Interdisciplinary Humanities Grant, and the Honors College.
