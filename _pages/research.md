## Our research falls into the following main areas:

1) Development of weighted ensemble path sampling strategies and software for efficient sampling of rare events with rigorous kinetics.  
2) Application of simulations to characterize mechanisms of protein conformational transitions, binding, and assembly processes.  
3) Development of simulation strategies for rational enhancement of kinetics for engineered protein conformational switches.  
4) Development of force fields for proteins and protein mimetics.

[Protein-protein binding pathways and kinetics from explicit-solvent simulations](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/sc/c8sc04811h#!divAbstract). Movie of a binding pathway for barnase (blue) and barstar (orange) from a weighted ensemble simulation. Residues at the binding interfaces of barnase (S38 and R59) and barstar (D35, D39, and W44) are highlighted in cyan and yellow, respectively. This simulation can be completed within 10 days using 16 modern GPUs. “The Story Unfolds” music by Jingle Punks is royalty-free.

[First atomistic simulations of protein-peptide binding pathways to yield an on-rate](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.6b01502). Movie of a binding pathway generated by weighted ensemble simulations involving a disordered p53 peptide (gold) and MDM2 protein (gray). "Anchor" residues which become the most buried upon binding are highlighted in red, blue, and green for F19, W23, and L26, respectively.

[First computational study to rationally enhance protein switching kinetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03228-6). Our strategy involved the use of the weighted ensemble strategy with residue-level simulations. Shown in the movie is a protein-based calcium sensor, switching from the "on" state (where fluorophores, represented as yellow spheres, are distant) to the "off" state (fluorophores adjacent), with the probability p (statistical weight) of each snapshot indicated in the lower right hand corner. Our results predicted mutations that resulted in a >32-fold enhancement in the switch kinetics. Guitar music for this work was composed and performed by Alex J.

[Shifts in the beta-sheet register of a protein-peptide complex](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511003833). Based on our conventional simulations in explicit solvent, rearrangement of a misregistered β-sheet involving a peptide fragment of the hNIFK signaling protein (yellow) and the complementary β-strand of the FHA domain receptor of the Ki67 cancer marker protein (cyan) occurs via an "aromatic crawling" mechanism in which the anchoring of peptide residue F263 into a transient hydrophobic pocket of the receptor appears to facilitate rearrangement to the native state with the intended beta-sheet register.

[Domain swapping of an engineered two-domain protein switch](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349510052549). The two domains are barnase (shades of blue) and ubiquitin (shades of red). In this conventional molecular simulation, domain swapping involves the less stable domain, barnase, in which intermolecular folding occurs between the barnase domains of two different molecules.
