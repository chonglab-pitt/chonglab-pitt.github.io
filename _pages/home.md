The Chong Lab

Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh

We are a highly collaborative group of people who work at the interface of chemistry, physics, and biology to explore the role of dynamics and kinetics in the function of biomolecules. We focus on the development and application of advanced simulation methods to generate the most detailed views possible for rare events in biology (e.g., protein binding and large-scale transitions in proteins). We also develop simulation strategies for the rational enhancement of kinetics for protein-based conformational switches. We are the primary developers of the AMBER ff15ipq/ff15ipq-m force fields and WESTPA, an open-source, highly scalable software package for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events.
