The Chong Lab

Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh

We use molecular simulations to generate the most detailed views possible of long-timescale biological processes. We also develop simulation strategies for aiding the rational design of protein-based conformational switches and are developers of the AMBER ff15ipq protein force field and WESTPA, an open-source, highly scalable software package for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events such as protein binding and large-scale transitions in proteins.
