title: "Recruiting for a Postdoc"
---

We are recruiting for one postdoctoral researcher in computational biophysics with a focus on emerging rare-event sampling and machine learning techniques. This position will involve a collaboration with Arvind Ramathan (Argonne National Lab/ University of Chicago) to integrate the WESTPA[1] software package for executing weighted ensemble rare-event sampling with the DeepDriveMD[2] software suite of deep learning/AI tools to further enhance the efficiency of sampling pathways and kinetics of long-timescale processes. Applications will involve atomic-level examinations of how disordered proteins mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form membrane-less organelles within cells to create unique environments for key biochemical reactions. 

The position provides unique opportunities to develop scalable, AI-enhanced rare-event sampling toolkits across leadership computing facilities spanning both NSF (Texas Advanced Computing Center/TACC) and DOE systems, including Argonne Leadership Computing Facility’s Exascale supercomputers, namely Aurora and Polaris, as well as Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility’s Frontier and Summit. The candidate will also have opportunities to leverage our strong interactions with industry, including OpenEye Scientific, Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA.  

Qualifications:
<ul>
  <li>Strong background in chemistry, physics, computer science, or related field </li>
  <li>Experience in high-performance computing and computational science </li>
  <li>Familiarity with deep learning / AI techniques is desired (including use of frameworks such as Pytorch, Tensorflow).  </li>
  <li>Proficiency in scientific programming using Python </li>
  <li>Ability to conduct independent research </li>
  <li>Strong interpersonal and communication skills </li>
</ul>
