Prof. Lillian Chong leads the development of the Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis ([WESTPA](https://github.com/westpa/westpa)), which is an open-source, highly scalable framework for carrying out extended-timescale simulations of rare events with rigorous kinetics. 



The Chong Lab has also developed open-source software for the following:

[Configuring plots based on data from both MD simulation and NMR spectroscopy](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt/MolDynPlot "MolDynPlot")

[Ramachandran plots from umbrella sampling](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt/Ramaplot "Ramaplot")

[Choosing color schemes for various types of color blindness](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt/misc_simulation_tools "Misc Simulation Tools")

[A Python library for kernel density estimation in n-dimensional space, including support for weighted samples](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt/kde "KDE")

[Calculation of fluorine relaxation rates from MD simulations](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt/fluorelax "fluorelax")

[Our other software projects can be found on the Chong Lab GitHub repository](https://github.com/chonglab-pitt "chonglab-pitt")
