Join us in our scientific adventures! 

We welcome applications from prospective postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates. We encourage a diversity of backgrounds, and applications from women and underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged. 

*Our Lab Values*

**Adventure** - We are unafraid to consider unfamiliar applications and to learn new concepts/tools for solving problems that excite us.

**Creativity** - We encourage blue sky thinking and following your own ideas.

**Rigor** - We value quality over quantity and maintain openness, integrity, and reproducibility in research, paying special attention to outliers.

**Persistence** - We value failures as opportunities for learning, noting that great discoveries are often made after countless failed attempts.

**Collaboration** - We enjoy collaborating with other labs to create a greater whole, including the integration of theory with experiment. 

**Diversity** - We seek to make science a global, inclusive effort in all aspects ranging from hosting visitors to organizing conferences to citing relevant work.

**Balance** - We value work/life balance and make responsible use of resources we are granted. We do our best to maintain a clean work space for a clear mind.
