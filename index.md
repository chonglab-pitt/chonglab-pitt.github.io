Our focus is on the use of physics-based computer simulations to generate atomically detailed views of rare events in biology (e.g., protein folding and binding) with rigorous kinetics. These efforts involve the development of weighted ensemble rare-events sampling methods and software ([WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa)). We also develop [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) force fields for proteins (ff15ipq) and their mimetics (ff15ipq-m).
