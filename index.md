Our focus is on the use of physics-based computer simulations to generate atomically detailed views of rare events in biology (e.g., protein folding and binding) with rigorous kinetics. We also develop simulation methods for aiding the rational design of protein-based conformational switches. We develop both weighted ensemble rare-events sampling methods and software ([WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa)], and [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) force fields for proteins (ff15ipq) and protein mimetics (ff15ipq-m).
