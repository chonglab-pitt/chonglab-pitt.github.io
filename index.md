We use molecular simulations to generate the most detailed views possible of long-timescale biological processes. We also develop simulation strategies for aiding the design of protein-based conformational switches. We are developers of the [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) [ff15ipq](https://pubs-acs-org.pitt.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00567)/[ff15ipq-m](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0019054) protein/protein-mimetics force fields and the open source, highly scalable [WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa/ "WESTPA") software for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events such as protein binding and large-scale transitions in proteins.
