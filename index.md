Our focus is on the use of molecular simulations to generate the most detailed views possible of long-timescale biological processes. We also develop simulation methods for aiding the design of protein-based conformational switches. We are developers of [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) force fields for proteins ([ff15ipq](https://pubs-acs-org.pitt.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00567), which includes parameters for fluorinated aromatic amino acids and protein mimetics ([ff15ipq-m](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/5.0019054). We maintain and develop the open source, highly scalable [WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa) software for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events such as protein-ligand (un)binding and large-scale transitions in proteins.
