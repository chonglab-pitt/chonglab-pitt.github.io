Our focus is on the use of molecular simulations to generate the most detailed views possible of complex biological processes. We also develop simulation methods for aiding the rational design of protein-based conformational switches. We are developers of [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) force fields for proteins (ff15ipq), including fluorinated amino acids, and protein mimetics (ff15ipq-m). We maintain and develop the open source, highly scalable [WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa) software for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events (e.g., protein-ligand (un)binding and large-scale transitions in proteins) with rigorous kinetics.
