We are a collaborative group of scientists who work at the interface of chemistry, physics, and biology to explore the role of dynamics and kinetics in the function of biomolecules. We focus on the development and application of advanced simulation methods to generate atomistic views of rare events in biology (e.g., protein binding and large-scale transitions in proteins). We also develop simulation strategies for rational enhancement of protein switching kinetics. We are the primary developers of the [WESTPA](https://westpa.github.io/westpa) software for weighted ensemble simulations of rare events and implicitly polarized [AMBER](https://ambermd.org) force fields (ff15ipq/ff15ipq-m).
